## Technologies used ##
HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, mySQL and Figma

## Objective ##
Create an interactive web application for CPS530 - Web Systems Development. This application gamifies mental health in a way that encourages users to keep track, evaluate, and seek help when needed. Specifically, we wanted to allow a user to keep track and evaluate their mental health by logging into the application and interacting with the wellness chatbot found on the user’s dashboard. We also wanted to encourage the user to seek help through the resources page which contains various links to different mental health sites and services.

## Design ##
The design of this platform was original with the inspiration for technologies and layout. This simplistic platform puts the user experience first for a personalized approach to interact with the user and track their progress. For reference, we used fitness tracking platforms (i.e. Strava).

## Data Validation ## 
Each page validates if the information is filled in properly and in a specific format (if needed). The login page and registration page review past data entries to validate the login/registration information is accurate (active or not).

## Responsiveness ##
This platform is fully compatible and 100% responsive with both smaller-screen devices such as smartphones and medium-screen devices such as tablets. As well, itlooks identical on all major browsers (i.e. Safari, Chrome, and Firefox).

## Accessibility ##
No major steps were taken in implementing features that would make the website accessible for individuals with disabilities. However, a dashboard theme toggle (which changes the dashboard from a light theme to a dark theme) was implemented for individuals with a specific visual impairment – photophobia. Photophobia is a common eye condition where a person is sensitive to light, causing discomfort in bright environments. Thus, our theme option allows them to switch the dashboard theme colour to whatever fits their needs.
